# Is It Raining Outside Weather Dashboard by Kevin Callaghan

## Description

This easy-to-use weather application will provide you a quick 5 day weather forecase with a simple city search.  

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

1. Here is the OpenWeatherMap API Documentation I used to make the API's and find current weather by city: https://openweathermap.org/current

2. After getting the lat and lon from the first API, here is the documentation I used for the second API: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 

3. I used documentation for a different weather API to get source code and plug in my query and API Key and then return the data I need.  Here is the documentation I used: https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-api/how-to-load-weather-data-in-javascript/ 

4. I used this Stack Overflow article as a reminder on storing and accessing local storage: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52505323/save-input-value-to-local-storage-and-retrieve-it-on-a-different-page
